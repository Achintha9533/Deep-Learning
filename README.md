Neural Network for Infix to Postfix TranslationProject DescriptionThis project implements a neural network to translate mathematical formulas from infix notation to postfix notation (also known as Reverse Polish Notation or RPN).Infix notation, such as $a + b * c$, is the most common form for human-readable mathematics. However, it can be ambiguous without rules of precedence or parentheses. Postfix notation, like $ab+c*$ or $abc*+$, eliminates this ambiguity by placing the operator after its operands, making it easier for computers to parse and evaluate using a stack-based approach.Problem StatementThe core problem addressed is the ambiguity of infix expressions. For example, the expression $a + b * c$ can be interpreted in two ways:Interpretation 1 (Infix): (a+b)\*cEquivalent Postfix: ab+c\*Interpretation 2 (Infix): a+(b\*c)Equivalent Postfix: abc\*+This project takes a data-driven approach to learn the correct postfix form from a given infix expression by modeling the translation as a sequence-to-sequence problem.Model ArchitectureThe neural network is built using a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture with an attention mechanism, which helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during translation.Encoder: An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network processes the input infix expression and compresses it into a context vector, which represents the state of the expression.Decoder: Another LSTM network, initialized with the encoder's final state, generates the output postfix expression one token at a time.Attention: A Luong-style attention mechanism is implemented to allow the decoder to "look back" at the encoder's output at each step, ensuring that the model maintains a strong connection between the input and output sequences.How to UseDependenciesTo run the notebook, you need to install the following Python libraries:pip install tensorflow gdown

Data GenerationThe project uses a recursive function to generate a diverse dataset of infix expressions. A standard algorithm based on a stack is then used to convert these expressions into their correct postfix form for training the model. The model learns the rules of operator precedence and associativity implicitly from this data.CreditsThis project is a conceptual implementation of a neural network for notation translation.
